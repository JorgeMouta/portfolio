      <p>
        Since I was a little boy, I've been fascinated and inspired by
        technology. I came in contact with Photoshop for the firstime 15 years
        ago, around the same time I did my first website. If I had to describe
        myself I would say I'm confident, curious, positive, and I'm always
        looking to improve.
